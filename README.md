### Textbooks

Writing a book in the field of cryptanalysis is a challenging task, as this field is constantly evolving. However, there are some books that explain the basics of cryptanalysis and provide a good starting point for beginners. The best way to learn cryptanalysis is by reading scientific papers and attempting to implement the attacks yourself.

Before starting to read the following books, it is recommended to have a good understanding of cryptography and mathematics, including basic probability theory, discrete mathematics, combinatorics, number theory, abstract algebra, and linear algebra.

#### A Self-Study Course in Block-Cipher Cryptanalysis

![bruce_schneier](./PageResources/bruce_schneier.png)

Studying cryptanalysis is difficult because there is no standard textbook, and no way of knowing which cryptanalytic problems are suitable for different levels of students. This paper attempts to organize the existing literature of block-cipher cryptanalysis in a way that students can use to learn cryptanalytic techniques and ways to break new algorithms.
